    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. It works by starting at a point and then moving in the direction of the steepest descent until it reaches a minimum. The steepest descent is the direction in which the function is decreasing most rapidly.\n",

    "To train a model using gradient descent, we start with a set of initial parameters. These parameters are the values of the variables in the model. We then repeatedly apply gradient descent to update the parameters. Each update moves the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent. This continues until the parameters converge to a minimum of the function.\n",

    "The choice of the learning rate is important for gradient descent. The learning rate is the size of the steps that are taken in the direction of the steepest descent. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm will converge slowly. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may diverge and never converge.\n",
